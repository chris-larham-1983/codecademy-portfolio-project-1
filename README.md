##General Information
This is my solution to *Codecademy*'s first portfolio project challenge.  
The objectives were to:
- build a message generator program using JavaScript
- use Git version control
- use the command line
- develop locally on your computer

The program that I have created outputs a random sentence of the form 'subject - verb - adverb'.  There are 50 possible subjects (standard pronouns, gender neutral pronouns, and names), 50 possible verbs, and 50 possible adverbs.  Thus, **125,000** sentences can be generated by this program (50 * 50 * 50).

##Technologies
This program is written using ES6-style JavaScript, and is run using a simple Node command (as illustrated in the section below).

##Setup
Simply download the 'project1.js' file to your computer and save it in your preferred directory.  Open up the terminal, navigate to the relevant directory, and use a simple Node command to run the program.  The images below show how to navigate to the relevant directory and enter the simple Node command, and demonstrate sample program output.
